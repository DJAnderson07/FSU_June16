# Resources
Plenty of helpful sheets for common/routine functions in R. For example: 
* https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf
* http://www.columbia.edu/~cjd11/charles_dimaggio/DIRE/resources/R/rFunctionsList.pdf

----
## Big picture
There are lots of functions that you will use and need as you get deeper into 
  programming with R. Gaining fluency with these functions is one of the keys to taking the "next step" with R and truly being comfortable with it. Some examples of functions I use routinely include the following:

* `rep()` repeats an element or vector a specified number of times
* `seq()` creates a sequence of numbers from `x` to `y`
* `:` creates an integer index that changes by 1
* `table()` creates a summary of the number of times an element occurs in a
   vector (similar to Frequencies in SPSS)
* `c()` creates a vector
* `merge()` merges two data frames together `by` a common identifier. Can
  handle left, right, inner, or full joins.

----
## Common functions (continued)
* `split()` breaks a dataset or a vector into a list, separated by a
  categorical variable
* `rbind()` row binds two or more matrices or data frames together. Note that
  the matrices/data frames must have the equivalent number of columns, and must
  have the same column names (which for matrices could be something like 
  `[,1]`)
* `cbind()` column binds two or more matrices or data frames together (no
  common identifier necessary)
* `ifelse()` vectorized operator for conditional recoding of a vector. Takes
   three arguments: If condition == TRUE, then carry out an operation, else carry out a different operation.
* `rnorm()`, `rbinom()`, `rpois()`, etc., create randomly generated data from 
   the specified distribution (with the specified distributional properties).
* `dnorm()`, `dbinom()`, `dpois()`, etc, calculate the likelihood of specific
   data occurring from the specified distribution (with the specified distributional properties).
* `str()` provides the basic structure of the object (most useful for lists and
   data frames).
* `head()` and `tail()` display the first 6 (head) and the last 6 (tail) rows
   of a given data frame.
* `summary()` provides statistical summary information on vectors

----
## Common functions (continued)
* `sample()` randomly select `n` observations from a vector
* `order()` organizing a vector in ascending or descending order (ascending by
  default)
* `rev()` reverses the elements of a vector
* `nrow()` calculates the number of rows in a matrix/data frame
* `ncol()` calculates the number of columns in a matrix/data frame
* `which()` logical evaluation; returns  elements in a vector that meet the
  specified condition
* `which.min()`, `which.max()` returns the index of minimum or maximum,
  respectively, from a vector
* `cut()` divides a continuous vector *x* into intervals at the specified
  breaks
* `na.omit()` removes all missing values from a vector, matrix, or data frame
* `unique()` select unique elements within a vector
* `paste()` and `paste0()` concatenates string elements (`paste0` has no
  separator, `paste` defaults to a space)

----
## Common functions (continued)

* `is.na()`, `is.null()`
* `length()`
* many others...

## Your Turn (probably fairly tough)
# Use some of the common/routine functions to do the following:
* Create a sequence vector from 100 to 237 that is of length 1000.
* Randomly order the vector
* Compute the likelihood of each point occurring from a normal distribution
  with $\mu$ = 178.32 and $\sigma$ = 15.67. Store the result in a new vector.
* Form a 1000 by 2 matrix that is composed of the sequence vector and
  the likelihood vector.
* Use the matrix to plot the relation between the sequence vector and the
  likelihood of each point.

----
* Create a sequence vector from 100 to 237 that is of length 10,000.

```{r lab1}
v <- seq(100, 237, length.out = 1e4)
head(v)
```

* Randomly order the vector

```{r lab2}
v <- sample(v, length(v))
head(v)
```

----
* Compute the likelihood of each point, and store the result in a new vector

```{r lab3}
lik <- dnorm(v, 178.32, 15.67)
head(lik)
```

* Form a 1000 by 2 matrix that is composed of the sequence vector and
  the likelihood vector.

```{r lab4}
m <- cbind(v, lik)
head(m)
```

----
* Use the matrix to plot the relation between the sequence vector and the
  likelihood of each point.

```{r lab5}
plot(m[ ,1], m[ ,2])
```
